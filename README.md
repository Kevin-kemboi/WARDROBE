Usage
Search: Type in the search bar to filter wardrobe items dynamically (e.g., "Blue" to find "Blue Slim Jeans").
Add Items: Click "+ Add Clothing" to open a form, enter a name (e.g., "Purple Scarf"), and click "Add" to append it to the dashboard.
Toggle Theme: Click the sun/moon icon in the navbar to switch between light and dark modes.
Navigation: Use Home/Dashboard links (currently static; extend with router views as needed).
Customization
Images: Replace picsum.photos URLs in App.vue with your own image assets in src/assets/ or a CDN.
Backend Integration: Update main.js to use Axios with your backend (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8001/) for persistent data.
Categories: Enhance the add form to include category selection by adding a <select> element in the form.
Styling: Adjust Tailwind classes in App.vue or add custom CSS in <style> to tweak the Louis Vuitton-inspired look.
Scripts
Development: npm run dev - Starts the Vite dev server.
Build: npm run build - Compiles the app for production.
Preview: npm run preview - Serves the built app locally.
Future Enhancements
Backend Integration: Connect to a REST API for CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).
State Management: Use Pinia for persistent state across page reloads.
Edit/Delete: Implement functionality for the edit and delete buttons.
Category Filter: Make the category dropdown functional to filter items.
Authentication: Add real login/register/logout logic with a backend.
